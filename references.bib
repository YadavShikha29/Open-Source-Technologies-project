   abstract = {Detecting spam on social networks is a significant challenge in natural language processing due to the sparse and ambiguous nature of the text. Existing methods for spam identification suffer from time-consuming processes and lack precision. To tackle these limitations, this study introduces the Octave Convolutional Multi-Head Capsule Nutcracker Network (OCMCNN). The OCMCNN approach begins by preprocessing the input dataset and extracting text features using the absolute deviation factor-class term frequency scheme. To identify the most optimal features, the study employs an oppositional Kepler optimization algorithm. The OCMCNN classifier is then utilized to predict spam and harmful email messages. It combines the Octave convolution layer, capsule layer, multi-head self-attention, and Nutcracker optimization. To evaluate its performance, the proposed system is compared to other techniques including Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), CapsNet, and Deep Belief Network (DBN) using metrics like precision, accuracy, F1-score, recall, error rate, and computation time. The results demonstrate that the OCMCNN classifier accomplishes higher accuracy of 99.6%, 99.4%, and 99.9%, precision of 99.67%, 99%, and 99.43%, recall of 100%, 99%, and 99.98%, and F1-score of 99.89%, 99.4%, and 99.3% on the Ling spam dataset, SpamAssassin, and Enron spam datasets, respectively. In conclusion, the OCMCNN technique offers an innovative method to deal with the spam detection challenge on social networks. Its superior accuracy performance holds promise for effectively combatting spam and harmful content on online platforms.},

   abstract = {In recent years, new malicious email attacks have emerged. We summarize two major challenges in the current field of malicious email detection using machine learning algorithms. (1) Current works on malicious email detection use different datasets and lack a unified and comprehensive open source dataset standard for evaluating detection performance. In addition, outdated data makes it difficult to detect new types of malicious email attacks. (2) There are limitations in feature selection and extraction. Relying only on static features or body textual features cannot satisfy the detection of both common phishing or spam email and new malicious emails that exploit protocol vulnerabilities. To address these problems, we propose the Exploiting Protocol Vulnerability Malicious Email (EPVME) dataset, which contains 49,136 malicious email samples. The EPVME dataset is constructed by summarizing and simulating the novel types of malicious email attacks that exploit email protocol vulnerabilities. In our dataset, the coverage of the types of malicious emails and the number of them are significantly increased. By collecting the currently available open source datasets, we build a large-scale dataset with 660,985 samples. Through two sets of comparative experiments on the dataset containing EPVME, we verify the necessity, reliability, and validity of the EPVME dataset. By using a large and comprehensive open source email dataset, we hope to help subsequent work on malicious email detection achieve comparative performance. Furthermore, we propose a new feature selection and construction method that combines both static features and textual features. We extract 79 static features from both the header and body parts of email samples, perform textual feature extraction on the pre-processed body parts, and combine various machine learning algorithms for detection model construction and experimental comparison. Our detection model can achieve an accuracy of 99.968% and a false positive rate of 0.099%.},

   abstract = {Unsolicited emails such as phishing and spam emails cost businesses and individuals millions of dollars annually. Several models and techniques to automatically detect spam emails have been introduced and developed yet non showed 100% predicative accuracy. Among all proposed models both machine and deep learning algorithms achieved more success. Natural language processing (NLP) enhanced the models' accuracy. In this work, the effectiveness of word embedding in classifying spam emails is introduced. Pre-trained transformer model BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is fine-tuned to execute the task of detecting spam emails from non-spam (HAM). BERT uses attention layers to take the context of the text into its perspective. Results are compared to a baseline DNN (deep neural network) model that contains a BiLSTM (bidirectional Long Short Term Memory) layer and two stacked Dense layers. In addition results are compared to a set of classic classifiers k-NN (k-nearest neighbors) and NB (Naive Bayes). Two open-source data sets are used, one to train the model and the other to test the persistence and robustness of the model against unseen data. The proposed approach attained the highest accuracy of 98.67% and 98.66% F1 score.},
